"""ContextVars for the currently-executing recorded function.

`current_job` carries a `JobContext` whenever execution is inside a
recorded wrapper. `attach()` and `attach_error()` consult this contextvar
to find the buffer to write into; both no-op when no context is set, so
removing `@recorder` (the basic-feature-set wrap-transparency contract)
leaves call-site `attach()`/`attach_error()` calls as silent no-ops
rather than raising.

contextvars propagate naturally through `await` and across `asyncio.gather`
(each task gets its own context copy), so concurrent recorded calls in
different tasks see isolated buffers.
